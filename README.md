# signalk-devantech

Signal K interface to the
[Devantech](https://www.devantech.co.uk)
range of general-purpose relay modules.

This project implements a plugin for the
[Signal K Node server](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server-node).

The
[Signal K data model](http://signalk.org/specification/1.0.0/doc/data_model.html)
and
[Alarm, alert and notification handling](http://signalk.org/specification/1.0.0/doc/notifications.html)
sections of the Signal K documentation may provide helpful orientation.

__signalk-devantech__ implements a control interface for multi-channel
relay devices manufactured by the UK company Devantech and includes
support for devices that are operated over USB, WiFi and wired
ethernet.

The plugin operates by intercepting Signal K put requests addressed to
switch bank paths under its control.
Valid requests are translated into relay module operating commands
which are sent to the appropriate connected device.

Devantech Ltd kindly supported the development of this plugin by making
some of its relay devices available to the author for evaluation and
testing.

## System requirements

__signalk-devantech__ has no special installation requirements.

If you intend using a Devantech relay device from the ETH or WIFI
ranges then you must configure the device on your network before
attempting to use it with this plugin.

## Installation

Download and install __signalk-devantech__ using the _Appstore_ link in
your Signal K Node server console.

The plugin can also be obtained from the
[project homepage](https://github.com/preeve9534/signalk-devantech)
and installed using
[these instructions](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server-node/blob/master/SERVERPLUGINS.md).

## Using the plugin

__signalk-devantech__ operates autonomously but must be configured
before use.

If you are using a relay module from Devantech, then most likely the
only configuration required will be to define the modules connected to
your system.

The configuration includes the following properties.

__Switch path template__ [switchpath]\
This required string property specifies a pattern for the Signal K
keys that will be used by the plugin to represent its configured
relay module channels.

The default value of 'electrical.switches.bank.{m}.{c}' can probably
be left untouched, but if you need to change it, then any path you
supply must include the tokens '{m}' and '{c}' as placeholders which
the plugin will interpolate with module-id and channel-id values for
each connected module.

__Module definitions__ [modules]\
This array property consists of a collection of *module definitions*
each of which describes a particular relay device you wish the plugin
to operate.

Each module definition has the following properties.

__Module identifier__ [id]\
This required string property must supply a unique identifier for the
module being defined.
This value will be used as part of the Signal K path used to identify
each relay channel (by replacing the '{m}' token in the __switchpath__
property discussed above) and will also be used in status and error
messaging.

__Module description__ [description]\
This optional string property can be used to supply some documentary
text.

__Module device type__ [deviceid]\
This required string  property supplies an identifier which selects a
specific device definition appropriate to the particular device that is
being used to implement this module.
See the [Device definitions](#device-definitions) section below for
more detail.

__Module connection string__ [devicecstring]\
This required string value supplies a connection string that tells the
plugin how to connect to the physical device implementing this module.

There are two styles of value: one describes a USB connection and the
other an ethernet connection (supporting both wired and wireless
devices).

A USB connection string has the form '__usb:__*device-path*' where
*device-path* specifies the serial device representing the physical
port to which the associated device is connected.
A typical value for a USB __devicecstring__ might be 'usb:/dev/ttyACM0'.

An ethernet connection string has the form   '__eth:__[*password*__@__]*address*__:__*port*'
where *address* is the IP address or hostname assigned to the associated
device, *port* is the port number on which it provides service and
*password* is the optional password required to operate the device.
A typical value for an ethernet __devicecstring__ might be 'eth:letmein@192.168.0.20:14555'.
The values you should use when constructing this string are defined
when you configure a Devantech ETH or WIFI relay device for first use:
consult your user guide for more information. 

__Module channels__ [channels]\
This array property introduces a collection of *channel definitions* each
of which describes one of the module's a relay bank channels using the
following properties.

__Channel index__ [index]
This number property defines the relay module channel to which the channel
definition relates, supplying the value that Signal K will use to identify
the associated relay.
This value is used by the plugin to overwrite the '{c}' token in the
__switchpath__ property discussed earlier and is also used in status and
error reporting.

__Channel address__ [address]\
This optional number property defines the physical channel on the
remote device with which this channel is associated.
If this property is omitted, then the plugin will use the value of the
__index__ property as the channel address.
 
__Channel description__ [description]\
This optional string property supplies some narrative that is used to
decorate the associated Signal K key's meta property with information
that can be picked up by other Signal K processes.

__Device definitions__ [devices]\
This array property defines an array of *device definitions*, each of
which describes the physical and interfacing characteristics of a
supported relay device.

A device must be defined here before it can be configured for use in a
module definition.
The plugin installation includes device definitions for Devantech relay
modules that were usable in the Signal K context and that were available
at the time of release.
If you need to add an unsupported device, then read-on.

Each device definition has the following properties.

__Device ids__ [id]\
This string property supplies a list of space-separated identifiers, one
for each of the relay devices to which the definition applies.
Typically these identifiers should be the model number assigned by the
device manufacturer.

__Number of relay channels__ [size]\
This number property specifies the number of relay channels supported by
the device.

__Protocol definitions__ [protocols]\
This array property introduces a list of *protocol definitions* each of
which defines a communication protocol supported by the device (usually
you will only need to specify one protocol).
Each protocol definition has the following properties.

__Protocol id__ [id]\
This string property specifies the protocol type being defined and must
be one of 'usb' or 'tcp'.
The value defaults to 'usb'.

__Protocol status command__ [statuscommand]\
This string property supplies the string that must be transmitted to the
device to elicit a status report.

__Protocol status report length__ [statuslength]\
This number property specifies the number of bytes in the status report
message transmitted by the device in response to a status command.
The value defaults to 1.

__Protocol authentication token__ [authenticationtoken]\
This string property specifies the format for an authentication token
'{A}' which can be used when defining operating commands (see below).
Some Devantech protocols require that a device password is decorated
with some identifying character sequence and the format of that sequence
can be specified here: typically this will include the token {p} which
will be interpolated with the password value specified in the
[devicecstring] property discussed previously.
 
__Protocol channel commands__ [channels]\
This required array property introduces a list of *channel definitions*
each of which specifies the commands required to operate a particular
relay on the device being defined.
Relays are identified by an ordinal address in the range 1..[size] and
each channel can be defined explicitly, but if there is a common format
for commands that applies to all channels, then a pattern can be defined
for a fake, generic, channel with address 0 and this will be elaborated
for each of the real channels on the device.

Each channel definition has the following properties.

__Channel address__ [address]\
This required number property gives the ordinal number of the relay
channel that is being defined (or 0 for a generic definition).

__Channel on command__ [oncommand]\
This required string property specifies the character sequence that
should be transmitted to the device to turn the relay identified by
[address] ON.

__Channel off command__ [offcommand]\
This required string  property specifies the character sequence that
should be transmitted to the device to turn the relay identified by
[address] OFF.

Both [oncommand] and [offcommand] can contain embedded JSON escape
sequences.
Additionally, the the following wildcard tokens will be substituted
with appropriate values before string transmission.

| Token | Replacement value |
|:------|:------------------|
| {c}   | The ASCII encoded address of the channel being processed. |
| {C}   | The binary encoded address of the channel being processed. |
| {A}   | The value of any defined authentication token. | 
| {p}   | The value of any defined module password. |

__Channel status mask__ [statusmask]\
This optional number property can be used to introduce a value that
will be bitwise AND-ed with state reports received from the device
so as to obtain a state value for a channel.
If no value is supplied then the plugin will compute a mask value from
the channel [address] using the formula (1 << (*address* - 1)).
